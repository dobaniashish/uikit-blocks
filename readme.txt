= UIkit library =

Please be aware that this plugin does not include the UIkit library in your website. You need to do this by yourself. We decided not to include the library so that you can modify UIkit to your own needs before loading it.

You'll find an example how to include it in your theme's `functions.php` in the [documentation](https://github.com/dobaniashish/uikit-blocks#uikit-library).

= Templates =

All blocks are implemented as [dynamic blocks](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/block-tutorial/creating-dynamic-blocks/). This makes it possible to overwrite the template of a block in your theme.

To overwrite a block template, you can copy the original template from the plugin into your theme directory in the same path as a starting point and adjust it to your needs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `uikit-blocks` directory into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Start adding blocks from the `UIkit Blocks` category
